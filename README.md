# Train-A

## Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to develop a platform for managing train trips. User roles include anonymous users, authorized users, and a resource manager with distinct responsibilities.

## Roles
- an anonymous user can search for routes and find trips, but before booking, they will be required to authorize.
- an authorized user can book trips and view their past trips.
- the resource manager has the authority to create trips and manage routes and schedules.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
